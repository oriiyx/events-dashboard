# Ekipa7 dashboard

Huh... Writing an application in a new framework within a 7 days window?
I guess we'll have to accept the challenge.
The business logic is mostly CRUD so at least there isn't any research besides the framework that I have to do.
Due to limited free time - I'll implement React on the frontend since I have very limited knowledge of Vue 2 compared to React.

What surprised me was that there were unit test requirements - I'll see what make sense to test.
I'm not a big fan of doing things just for the sake of doing them.
